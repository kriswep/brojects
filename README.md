# &lt;brojects&gt;

Better Github projects.

Interact<sve and flexible project management on top of Github projects.

## Outline

**Attention:** This is still 'Work in Progress' and not yet usable.

The plan is to make an improved UI for Github Project with the help of their API. 
That means, you will always be able to switch back to normal Github Pages.

**GOALS:**

 - [ ] As realtime as possible (Could actually be hard, since API won't push)
 - [ ] Option to create cards as issues directly
 - [ ] Improved ability to change card/issue texts from project page
 - [ ] Add/Remove labels based on column
 - [ ] ... More

## Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can find the most recent version of their development guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

It uses Redux for state management.
